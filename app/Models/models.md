# Larvela Models

The Larvela eCommerce platform uses basic standard models to implement a clean Eloquent based access to the Database.

## Status

This is the initial commit of models. Please note that a refactor of all models has been occuring since January 2018 and 
many of these files will be replaced.

Check back later for a final release of the Models and relevant readme file.

Thanks
