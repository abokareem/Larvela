# Listeners

The Event system is not used to any major degree in Larvela other than the Failed Login Event Listener so only the basic framework provided Listener Events are implemented. They have been enabled in the Provider code so they are defined here for future additions.

See app/Jobs for more info on what business login is implemented when the Failed Login Listener is triggered.
