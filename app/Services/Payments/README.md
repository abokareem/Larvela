# Larvela Payment Gateways


On start up the AppServiceProvider loads any *_Payment.php classes and this provides an entry point to load in additional Payment Methods.

This code is Alpha stage and the Relevant Controller(s) will need to be changed to recognize which payment gateway is available. How this is to be achieved is yet to be decided.

Keep you posted.
