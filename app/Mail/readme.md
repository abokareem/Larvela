# Mailable Classes

These classes represent the emails you are sending to customers in response to various store actions.

## Blade Template Location

To make it easy to build templated blades on a per store basis, the actual blades are stored using the store ENV code.

The path to the blades is as follows: resources/views/Mail/<store_env_code>/email_blades_go_here

## Default Store Templates

The default store templates will be in resources/views/Mail/DEMO/emails_here.blade.php
