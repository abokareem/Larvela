# Templates

These files represent the templates for the site, in particular the Administration Pages.

The Template loads the HTML HEAD sectionawhich includes CSS and Javascript for your admin pages and you create the overall shell for your content for the following:

 * Administration Pages
 * PDF Document pages (These are pages which will then be converted to PDF, so they typically do not have a menu bar at the top).

These templates are "extended" in content pages so the content is presented with the right outer template.

## Theme Templates

The template structure for a theme is loaded from the Theme directory.
